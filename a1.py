#Write a Python program to perform the following operations:

b = int(input("Enter Second Number : "))

d = a-b #Here we are Subtracting a-b
e = a*b #Here we are Multiplicating a*b
f = a//b #Here we are floor Dividing a//b
g = a%b #Here we are finding remainder a%b
h = a/b #Here we are dividing a/b
i = a**b #Here we are finding exponential a**b
