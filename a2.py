#Exercise 2: Comparison Operators
#Write a Python program that asks for two numbers and checks:
a = int(input("Enter First Number : "))
b = int(input("Enter Second Number : "))
if  a > b: # we have to prove that A Greater Than B
  print (a," : is  Greater Than", b)
elif  a == b:
    print(a," : is  equal to", b)
elif a <= b:
    print(a," : is Less Than Or Equal  to ",b)
